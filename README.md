# WineIQ-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Quality-Scoring
Wine Quality Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical features such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content. The project implements an end-to-end pipeline—from model training to containerized deployment—using modern MLOps practices.
